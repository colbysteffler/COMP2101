# Get the current hostname using the hostname command and save it in a variable

# Tell the user what the current hostname is in a human friendly way

# Ask for the user's student number using the read command

# Use that to save the desired hostname of pcNNNNNNNNNN in a variable, where NNNNNNNNN is the student number entered by the user

# If that hostname is not already in the /etc/hosts file, change the old hostname in that file to the new name using sed or something similar and
#     tell the user you did that
#e.g. sed -i "s/$oldname/$newname/" /etc/hosts

# If that hostname is not the current hostname, change it using the hostnamectl command and
#     tell the user you changed the current hostname and they should reboot to make sure the new name takes full effect
#e.g. hostnamectl set-hostname $newname
